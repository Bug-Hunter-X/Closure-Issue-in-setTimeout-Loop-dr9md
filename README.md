This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to closures within loops using `setTimeout`. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.  The issue arises from how closures capture variables in JavaScript's lexical scoping. The solution uses an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) to create a new scope for each iteration, thus capturing the correct value of `i`.
